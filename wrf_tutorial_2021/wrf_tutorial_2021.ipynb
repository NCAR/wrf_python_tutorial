    "\n",
    " - WRF-Python is a post-processing tool similar to NCL's WRF Package\n",
    "     - Contains over 30 diagnostic routines (CAPE, storm relative helicity, cloud top temperature, etc)\n",
    "     - Interpolation routines (level, cross section, surface)\n",
    "     - Utilities to help with plotting via cartopy, basemap, PyNGL\n",
    " - WRF-ARW only\n",
    " - WRF-Python is **NOT** a tool for running the WRF-ARW model with Python \n",
    " \n",
    "## Where can I find help with WRF-Python? ##\n",
    " - [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NCAR/wrf-python) \n",
    "     - WRF-Python is open source, and we highly encourage public input with it's development process\n",
    "     - Great place to go if you find bugs in the code, have any functionality you want to see, or to ask and answer community questions\n",
    " - [WRF-Python Talk](https://groups.google.com/a/ucar.edu/g/wrfpython-talk) Google Group \n",
    "     - A bit more for code issues, user support, and general questions\n",
    " - [WRF-Python ReadTheDocs](https://wrf-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) page\n",

    "## What happened NCL's WRF package/ Why is this in Python? ##\n",
    "NCAR has made the decision to \"pivot to Python\" as the scripting language platform of choice for future development of analysis and visualization tools. Currently, the NCL software is in \"maintenance mode\" meaning new features will not be added nor will non-critical software defects be addressed. With that being said, The GeoCAT Team is dedicated to providing tutorial and example materials to help aid NCL users in the transition from NCL to Python. "

    "\n",
    "You may find that your wrfout file is just too large for what you need to do with it (like sending it in an email or uploading to GitHub). To solve this, you may want to subset the file data for only the data variables necessary for your project. This will allow you to shrink the file down to a more 'bare-bones' version of the original file which will also reduce the file size. This is when using xarray may be a good idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where can I find out what variables are necessary for a WRF-Python variable? ###\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, the variables defined below are enough, but sometimes an extra variable is necessary to perform the function. The [source code](https://github.com/NCAR/wrf-python/blob/develop/src/wrf/routines.py) of 'getvar' is the best place to start finding the variables used. You can usually track the variables through your IDE of choice by command-clicking them, but if that isn't working, the GitHub repository contains the full source code for wrf-python. The quick guide on this step is as follows:\n",
    " \n",
    " 1. Open the source code in GitHub for the *getvar* function. This is the 'routines.py' file.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " 2. Starting at line 38, there is a list called _FUNC_MAP which really tells getvar where to look for the correct routines for processing the data necessary for the requested variable.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " 3. For this example, I am wanting 'height_agl'. So I will scroll to height_agl on line 82 and see that it uses the function 'get_height_agl'\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " 4. I will then scroll to the top and see that 'get_height_agl' is is in the file 'g_geoht'\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " 5. Knowing this, I will return to the src/wrf directory and go to the g_geoht.py file \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " 6. Next, look at the function _get_geoht starting on line 12. This is the \"inner\" wrapper function, that means it does most of the heavy lifting of the \"outter\" wrapper, which we as users interact with. \n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " 7. In looking at the inner wrapper, I see that it needs either the variable \"PH\" with \"PHB\" and \"HGT\" (line 87) or the variable \"GMT\" with variable \"HGT_M\" (line 99).\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " 8. So if I were subsetting my dataset with the code below, I would want to make sure that the variables from line 87 or 99 were included in 'toinclude'.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " 9. Then I would run this code with my wrfout file and test it in my Python code to ensure all necessary data variables were included. If any variable is missing, you would be given and error message telling you which variable is missing, at which point you would just need to update the 'toinclude' section and re-run the subsetting code."
